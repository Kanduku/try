                  <ul>
                      <li>Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals. The act or process of making something completely clean and free from bacteria: For more   sanitization, put the feeding tray in the dishwasher after use. Sanitizing involves¬†the use of heat or chemicals to reduce the number of microorganisms to safe level The Food Code requires that chemical sanitizers used in retail food facilities must be capable of reducing the number of disease causing organisms by 99.999%.

                      </h4>
                      If people are good at something, then it is building up excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Harmful CO2 contributes to climate change, the biggest current problem the world has to deal with. Trees, however, help fight it. They absorb CO2 removing it from the air and storing it while releasing oxygen. Annually, an acre of trees absorbs the amount of carbon dioxide equal to driving your car 26 000 miles. Trees are our main survival tools; only one tree can produce enough oxygen for four people.

                      <h4>COOLING-DOWN THE STREETS & NATURAL AIR CONDITIONING
                      </h4>Every year we listen to the shocking global warming news. For instance, the average temperature in Los Angeles has risen by 6F in 50 years, and the average global temperature grew by 1.4 F. This happens as tree coverage declines. Removing trees and replacing them with heat absorbing asphalt roads and buildings makes cities much warmer. Trees are cooling cities by up to 10 F by providing shade and releasing water.
                      strategically placed trees around your home can significantly cut air conditioning needs? Not only will this make your wallet thicker, but it will also reduce carbon dioxide and emissions from power plants. Architects and environmentalists sat together and came up with the great solution ‚Äì green roofs. Green roofs are an amazing way to incorporate vegetation to your home and provide environmental benefits for your community while saving money on cooling bills.<br><br><br><br>
